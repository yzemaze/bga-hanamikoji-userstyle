# bga-hanamikoji-userstyle
CSS for Hanamikoji on BGA

Main features are reduced whitespace/margins and a fixed spot for waiting_card_zone.
(cf. https://boardgamearena.com/bug?id=86954 & https://boardgamearena.com/bug?id=86955)

It should work fine on windows/screens 1280px or wider and with "Player area position" set to "Above". Some margins are pretty tight. So in some edge cases cards overlap other graphics slightly (e.g. 5*5).
